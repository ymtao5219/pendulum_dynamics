# Multi-Mass Pendulum Chain Dynamics Project

This project investigates the complex dynamics of a multi-mass pendulum chain, including chaos, quasi-periodic motion, and thermodynamic behavior in longer chains. It uses numerical simulations to study how these dynamics change with varying initial conditions and the number of pendulums.
